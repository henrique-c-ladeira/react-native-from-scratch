# React Native from scratch

React Native from scratch is a minimal integration of React Native in a Swift and (TODO) Kotlin project made from scratch.

This project is still under construction as only the Swift project is configured.

Contributions are very much welcome!

## Quick Start

Clone the project, at project's root folder, run `yarn`

Navigate to ios folder and run `pod install`

Run `yarn ios` to build for iOS or open XCode and build from there.

Metro server can be initiated with `yarn start`.

## TODO

- Create a Kotlin project and integrate with React Native
